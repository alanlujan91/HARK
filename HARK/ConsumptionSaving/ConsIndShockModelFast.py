"""
Classes to solve canonical consumption-savings models with idiosyncratic shocks
to income.  All models here assume CRRA utility with geometric discounting, no
bequest motive, and income shocks are fully transitory or fully permanent.

It currently solves three types of models:
   1) A very basic "perfect foresight" consumption-savings model with no uncertainty.
   2) A consumption-savings model with risk over transitory and permanent income shocks. #todo
   3) The model described in (2), with an interest rate for debt that differs
      from the interest rate for savings. #todo

See NARK https://HARK.githhub.io/Documentation/NARK for information on variable naming conventions.
See HARK documentation for mathematical descriptions of the models being solved.
